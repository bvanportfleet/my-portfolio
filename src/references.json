He is such a fast learner and is constantly sharpening his skills with the latest technologies and certifications.

Anyone who hires him will see him hit the ground running and will immediately recognize how skilled he is. On top of that, his communication skills are excellent and his customers have always given him high satisfaction survey results. He is a gem and any team would be lucky to have him."

We worked in the Advertising department for Meijer for a few years, and then we both moved to Farmers Insurance, where we worked in the Foremost Marketing department for 22 years. For about 10 of those years I was a manager, with Brian being one of my team members. I have been consistently impressed by both Brian's attitude toward his work and his performance on the job. Brian is a dream employee and co-worker. His mind is a sponge and he is extremely adept at learning new technologies quickly. Brian has been instrumental in creating best practices for our team for every aspect of the development process."

Most recently I worked closely in a collaborative manner with Brian as a Front-End Web Developer and me as a Sr. Graphic Designer at Farmers Insurance. I found Brianâ€™s in-depth understanding of web technology and content management extremely helpful when creating designs he would be utilizing. He is very knowledgeable with web, portals, and content management and is never afraid to share that knowledge with other colleagues. Anyone looking for a front-end web developer with timely responses and value-added should look no further. Brian VanPortfleet is great at curating, creating, and managing content, and highlighting content from angles others may not have thought about. Brian would be an asset to your web team."
